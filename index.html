    A website about new ideologies in the tech sector, and the conspiracy
    theories people write about them.

    <h1>What is TESCREAL?</h1>

    TESCREAL is an acronym for a set of ideologies common within the tech
    sector. It's short for:

    <ol>
      <li>Transhumanism</li>
      <li>Extropianism</li>
      <li>Singularitarianism</li>
      <li>Cosmism</li>
      <li>Rationalism</li>
      <li>Effective Altruism</li>
      <li>Longtermism</li>
    </ol>

    While there are connections between these ideologies, many people who use
    the term "TESCREAL" are using it to promote conspiracy theories, including
    all the baggage that comes with them. In particular, many TESCREAL
    conspiracy theories have antisemitic elements, which are often neglected by
    both supporters and opponents of their ideas.
